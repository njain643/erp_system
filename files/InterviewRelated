Download file:

If you want to serve pdf file located in your file system then you need to understand some terminology .

Content-Type Header : The Content-Type entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource . it basically used for MIME type .

response[‘content_type’] = ‘application/pdf’
Content-Disposition Header : In a regular HTTP response, the Content-Disposition response header is a header indicating if the content is expected to be displayed inline in the browser, that is, as a Web page or as part of a Web page, or as an attachment, that is downloaded and saved locally.

you want it download automatically so use attachment

response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment;filename=file.pdf'
Now Simple return HttpResponse with pdf content

with open('path/test.pdf', 'rb') as pdf:
	response = HttpResponse(pdf.read())
	reponse['content_type'] = 'application/pdf'
	response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment;filename=file.pdf'
	return response
Just by changing MIME type we can indicate to the browser that we’ve returned a response of a different format.
